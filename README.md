# odin-landing-page

This site is the result of course work assigned in the foundations section of The Odin Project.

The brief was to replicate a landing-page outlined in a design document provided as seen below.

The project gives an opportunity to reinforce and asses our understanding of the material 
covered to this point, with a focus on HTML and CSS.
