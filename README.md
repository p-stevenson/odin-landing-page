# odin-landing-page

This site is the result of course work assigned in the foundations section of The Odin Project.
The brief was to replicate a landing-page outlined in a design document (shown below) provided. 
The project is gives us an opportunity to reinforce and asses our understanding of the material 
covered to this point, with a focus on HTML and CSS in particular.
